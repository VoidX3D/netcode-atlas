                <p>DNS (Domain Name System) is the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names (like netcode-atlas.dev) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1). When you enter a URL in your browser, it queries DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address before establishing a connection to the website.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Authoritative DNS servers</strong> store the actual DNS records for specific domains. They provide definitive answers to DNS queries for those domains.</p>
                <p><strong>Recursive DNS servers</strong> (or resolvers) act as intermediaries between clients and authoritative servers. They receive DNS queries from clients, perform the necessary lookups across multiple DNS servers, and return the final answer to the client.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>DNS caching stores DNS query results temporarily to improve performance and reduce load on DNS servers. When a DNS resolver receives a query, it first checks its cache. If the answer exists and hasn't expired (based on TTL values), it returns the cached result instead of querying authoritative servers again.</p>
                <p>Caching occurs at multiple levels: operating system, browser, ISP resolvers, and other intermediate DNS servers.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) adds security to the Domain Name System by enabling DNS responses to be validated cryptographically. It protects against attacks like DNS cache poisoning and spoofing by providing:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Data origin authentication - Verifying that data came from the correct source</li>
                  <li>Data integrity protection - Ensuring data wasn't modified in transit</li>
                </ul>
                <p>DNSSEC uses public-key cryptography to create digital signatures for DNS data, allowing resolvers to verify the authenticity of DNS responses.</p>

                What is CORS and how does it work?

              </div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that allows web applications running at one origin to access resources from a different origin. Browsers enforce the same-origin policy by default, which prevents web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.</p>
                <p>CORS works by using additional HTTP headers that tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin.</p>

                <p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks. It allows website administrators to specify which domains the browser should consider as valid sources of executable scripts, styles, images, and other resources.</p>
                <p>CSP is implemented via HTTP headers or meta tags and works by whitelisting sources of approved content, preventing the browser from loading malicious assets.</p>

                <p>WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing real-time data exchange between client and server. Key differences from HTTP:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Connection</strong>: WebSockets maintain a persistent connection, while HTTP creates new connections for each request</li>
                  <li><strong>Communication</strong>: WebSockets enable bidirectional communication, while HTTP is primarily request-response</li>
                  <li><strong>Overhead</strong>: WebSockets have lower overhead after the initial handshake</li>
                  <li><strong>Use cases</strong>: WebSockets are ideal for real-time applications like chat, gaming, and live updates</li>

                <p><strong>Cookies</strong>: Small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer. They are sent with every HTTP request to the domain, have size limits (~4KB), and can have expiration dates.</p>
                <p><strong>localStorage</strong>: Web storage API that allows JavaScript to store data in the browser with no expiration time. Data persists until explicitly deleted, with larger storage limits (typically 5-10MB).</p>
                <p><strong>sessionStorage</strong>: Similar to localStorage but data is cleared when the page session ends (when the browser is closed). Useful for temporary data that shouldn't persist across sessions.</p>

                <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data in transit. It works using TLS (Transport Layer Security) or its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt communications between web browsers and servers.</p>
                <p>The HTTPS process involves:
                  <br>1. TCP connection establishment
                  <br>2. TLS handshake to establish encryption parameters
                  <br>3. Certificate verification to ensure server authenticity

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. These factors typically fall into three categories:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> - Something you know (password, PIN)</li>
                  <li><strong>Possession</strong> - Something you have (phone, security key)</li>
                  <li><strong>Inherence</strong> - Something you are (fingerprint, facial recognition)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>2FA works by requiring a combination of two factors, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if they compromise one factor (like a password).</p>

                <p>The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin. Two URLs have the same origin if they have the same protocol, host, and port.</p>

                <p>Lazy loading is a technique that delays the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed. Instead of loading all resources when the page first loads, lazy loading defers loading of below-the-fold content or content that might not be needed immediately.</p>
